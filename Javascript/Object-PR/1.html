<!-- ### Question 1: Imagine you have an array of student objects, where each object contains the student's name and their
score. Your task is to find and display the names of students who scored higher than 90 marks. Write a JavaScript
function to accomplish this. Use a loop to iterate through the array, a condition to check if the score is greater than
90, and then display the names of the high-scoring students. -->
